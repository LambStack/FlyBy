  <h1>Welcome to FlyBy!</h1>
  <p>On this page you can take a picture of a flyer,
    FlyBy will then use Google Cloud Machine Learning to try and 
    pick out all the important bits of information, and add it to your calendar.
  </p>
  <p>We'll get things a bit wrong sometimes, but don't worry! You'll have a chance
    to review the event before it's added to your calendar.</p>
    <h3>With this app, event planning will just Fly By!</h3>
